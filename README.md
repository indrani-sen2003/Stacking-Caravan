Ensemble learning technique
Stacking
The program performs stacking ensemble learning operation on the Caravan dataset and successfully improves the model accuracy. 
In the first level applies 4 classifiers and calculates the accuracy score of these classifiers. 
In the second level combines the prediction of all these classifiers to form a new data frame and 
trains the machine using logistic regression.
The final prediction is of 94% accuracy
